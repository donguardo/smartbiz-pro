- Use React Three Fiber for decorative 3D scenes so renderer lifecycle, resize, and cleanup stay React-managed.
- UI wording lives in the backend translations table (key, lang en/tl); src/lib/i18n-dict.ts is the offline fallback and seed source — keeps copy editable without code changes.
- BIZBOT uses one browser-local AI SDK UIMessage conversation and a global floating client — matching the chosen single-device chat experience.
- The opening video is browser-local first-visit onboarding and emits completion before the install prompt — prevents overlapping first-run experiences.
